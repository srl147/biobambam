biobambam
======

This package contains some tools for processing BAM files including

 - bamcollate2: reads BAM and writes BAM reordered such that alignment
   or collated by query name
 - bammarkduplicates: reads BAM and writes BAM with duplicate alignments
   marked using the BAM flags field
 - bammaskflags: reads BAM and writes BAM while masking (removing)
   bits from the flags column

   setting. This tool is capable of multi-threading.
