.TH BAMCOLLATE 1 "July 2013" BIOBAMBAM
.SH NAME
bamcollate - collate reads in a BAM file by name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B bamcollate
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Please note: This program is deprecated. Please use bamcollate2 instead.
bamcollate is only present for compatibility reasons with older scripts.
.PP
bamcollate reads a BAM file from standard input, collates the contained
reads/alignments by name and writes the resulting data to standard output in BAM format.
.PP
The following key=value pairs can be given:
.PP
.B tmpfile=<filename>
file name of temporary file used for collation. By default a temporary file
is created in the current directory.
.PP
.B level=<-1|0|1|9|11>:
set compression level of the output BAM file. Valid
values are
.IP -1:
zlib/gzip default compression level
.IP 0:
uncompressed
.IP 1:
zlib/gzip level 1 (fast) compression
.IP 9:
zlib/gzip level 9 (best) compression
.P
If libmaus has been compiled with support for igzip (see
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/igzip-a-high-performance-deflate-compressor-with-optimizations-for-genomic-data)
then an additional valid value is
.IP 11:
igzip compression
.PP
.B colhashbits=<20>
base two logarithm of the size of the hash table used for collation (the
default value is 20 and should work reasonably well for most input files)
.PP
.B collistsize=<524288>
size of hash table overflow list in alignments (the default is 512k and should
work reasonably well for most input files)
.PP
.B pairsonly=<0|1>:
output pairs only. Valid values are
.IP 0:
output all alignments
.IP 1:
output pairs only (no unmatched/orphans)
.PP
.B readgroups=<>:
output only reads/alignments in the given list of read groups. Multiple
read groups are given separated by comma. No filtering is performed if the
key is not given.
.PP
.B md5=<0|1>:
md5 checksum creation for output file. Valid values are
.IP 0:
do not compute checksum. This is the default.
.IP 1:
compute checksum. If the md5filename key is set, then the checksum is
written to the given file. If md5filename is unset, then no checksum will be computed.
.PP
.B md5filename
file name for md5 checksum if md5=1.
.PP
.B index=<0|1>:
compute BAM index for output file. Valid values are
.IP 0:
do not compute BAM index. This is the default.
.IP 1:
compute BAM index. If the indexfilename key is set, then the BAM index is
written to the given file. If indexfilename is unset, then no BAM index will be computed.
.PP
.B indexfilename
file name for BAM index if index=1.
