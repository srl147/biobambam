.TH BAMSORT 1 "July 2013" BIOBAMBAM
.SH NAME
bamsort - sort BAM files by coordinate or query name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B bamsort
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
bamsort reads a BAM, SAM or CRAM file, sorts it by coordinate
(lexicographical by reference sequence id and position on reference sequence)
or query name and writes the sorted file in BAM, SAM or CRAM format.
.PP
Lexicographical order denotes that pairs (a,b) and (c,d) will be ordered
such that (a,b) < (c,d) if either a < c or a = c and b < d. For coordinates
this means that the alignments are first grouped by reference sequence id
(i.e. all alignments for one chromosome appear in one block) and within the
block for each reference sequence the alignments are ordered by the start
position of on this sequence.
.PP
The order by query name decomposes the read names into parts containing
numbers and such containing no number. A read name A15_30_C50 will for
instance be split into the components A, 15, _, 30, _C and 50. The comparison
of read names is performed lexicographically along this decomposition, where
number fields are compared as numbers. As an example we have A15<B12 as
A<B and A9<A12 as A=A and 9<12 (where 9 and 12 are considered as numbers and
not as the sequences of their digits).
.PP
If the memory buffer given is not sufficiently large to process the input
file, then the program writes intermediate results to a temporary file. This
file can be large and depending on the compression of the input file larger
than the input itself.
.PP
The following key=value pairs can be given:
.PP
.B SO=<coordinate|queryname>: 
set the sort order. Valid values are
.IP coordinate:
sort alignments by coordinate
.IP queryname
sort alignments by query name
.PP
.B level=<-1|0|1|9|11>:
set compression level of the output BAM file. Valid
values are
.IP -1:
zlib/gzip default compression level
.IP 0:
uncompressed
.IP 1:
zlib/gzip level 1 (fast) compression
.IP 9:
zlib/gzip level 9 (best) compression
.P
If libmaus has been compiled with support for igzip (see
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/igzip-a-high-performance-deflate-compressor-with-optimizations-for-genomic-data)
then an additional valid value is
.IP 11:
igzip compression
.PP
.B verbose=<1>:
Valid values are
.IP 1:
print progress report on standard error
.IP 0:
do not print progress report
.PP
.B blockmb=<1024>:
set size of the internal memory sorting buffer in megabytes. The default
buffer size is one gigabyte.
.PP
.B tmpfile=<filename>:
set the prefix for temporary file names
.PP
.B disablevalidation=<0|1>:
sets whether input validation is performed. Valid values are
.IP 0:
validation is enabled (default)
.IP 1:
validation is disabled
.PP
.B md5=<0|1>:
md5 checksum creation for output file. This option can only be given if
outputformat=bam. Then valid values are
.IP 0:
do not compute checksum. This is the default.
.IP 1:
compute checksum. If the md5filename key is set, then the checksum is
written to the given file. If md5filename is unset, then no checksum will be computed.
.PP
.B md5filename
file name for md5 checksum if md5=1.
.PP
.B index=<0|1>:
compute BAM index for output file. This option can only be given if
outputformat=bam. Then valid values are
.IP 0:
do not compute BAM index. This is the default.
.IP 1:
compute BAM index. If the indexfilename key is set, then the BAM index is
written to the given file. If indexfilename is unset, then no BAM index will be computed.
.PP
.B indexfilename
file name for output BAM index if index=1.
.PP
.B inputformat=<bam>: input file format.
All versions of bamsort come with support for the BAM input format. If
the program in addition is linked to the io_lib package, then the following
options are valid:
.IP bam:
BAM (see http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)
.IP sam:
SAM (see http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)
.IP cram:
CRAM (see http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/cram_toolkit)
.PP
.B outputformat=<bam>: output file format.
All versions of bamsort come with support for the BAM output format. If
the program in addition is linked to the io_lib package, then the following
options are valid:
.IP bam:
BAM (see http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)
.IP sam:
SAM (see http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)
.IP cram:
CRAM (see http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/cram_toolkit). This format is not advisable for data sorted by query name.
.PP
.B I=<[stdin]>: 
input filename, standard input if unset.
.PP
.B O=<[stdout]>: 
output filename, standard output if unset.
.PP
.B inputthreads=<[1]>:
input helper threads, only valid for inputformat=bam.
.PP
.B outputthreads=<[1]>:
output helper threads, only valid for outputformat=bam.
.PP
.B reference=<[]>:
reference FastA file for inputformat=cram and outputformat=cram. An index file (.fai) is required. 
.PP
.B range=<>:
input range to be processed. This option is only valid if the input is a coordinate sorted and indexed BAM file
.PP
.B fixmates=<0|1>:
fix mate information as bamfixmateinformation would do. Input is assumed to
be collated by query name (no changes will be applied to mates which are not
adjacent in the input stream). By default this option is disabled.
.PP
.B calmdnm=<0|1>:
calculate the MD and NM fields as a side effect. By default the fields are
not calculated. Calculation is only performed if sorting is performed by
coordinate. If calmdnm=1, then the parameter calmdnmreference in required.
The supported file formats can be found in the manual page for bammdnm.
.PP
.B calmdnmreference=<[]>:
name of reference sequence file if calmdnm=1.
.PP
.B calmdnmrecompindetonly=<0|1>:
compute MD/NM fields in the presence of indeterminate (N) bases only. This
option is only relevant if calmdnm=1. By default the fields are computed for
all mapped alignments if calmdnm=1.
.PP
.B calmdnmwarnchange=<0|1>:
warn if MD/NM field which was computed is differing from a previously
existing field. By default no warnings are produced.
